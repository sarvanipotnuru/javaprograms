For each loop
    
	The Java for-each loop or enhanced for loop. It provides an alternative approach to traverse the array or collection in Java. 
	It is mainly used to traverse the array or collection elements. The advantage of the for-each loop is that it eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code more readable. 
	It is known as the for-each loop because it traverses each element one by one.
    The drawback of the enhanced for loop is that it cannot traverse the elements in reverse order. 
	Here, you do not have the option to skip any element because it does not work on an index basis. Moreover, you cannot traverse the odd or even elements only.
    But, it is recommended to use the Java for-each loop for traversing the elements of array and collection because it makes the code readable.
	
	Syntax
	for(data_type variable : array | collection){  
//body of for-each loop  
}  
 
 package loops;

public class foreach {
	public static void main (String args[]) {
		
		String[] array= {"pen","papper","book"};
		for(String x:array) {
			System.out.println(x);
		}
}
}


/*output
pen
papper
book
